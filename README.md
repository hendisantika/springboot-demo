## Configure the Droplet for SpringBoot Web App

**Install JRE in the Droplet**

Run the following commands (This needs to be run from the terminal we used to ssh into the Droplet)

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jre-headless
java -version
```

## Copy Artifacts into the Droplet

Weâ€™ll copy the JAR into /artifact directory and copy the systemd service file to /etc/systemd/system directory

Create a directory named artifact in the root directory of the Droplet

`mkdir /artifact`

Now copy the JAR and the systemd service file into the Droplet. Open a new terminal window on your local system and run
the following command (Again replace the IP in bold with the public IP of your Droplet)

```shell
scp -i key/id_rsa target/spring-boot2-demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar root@157.245.100.221:/artifact
scp -i key/id_rsa spring-boot.service root@157.245.100.221:/etc/systemd/system
```
